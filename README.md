# rock-paper-scissors

This is a basic rock-paper-scissors game played in console. I made my prototype in Python for ease of testing the logic. The project prompt was not specific about the requirement, so I have the game play through 5 whole rounds instead of first to 3 wins. I also do not count ties for advancing rounds.
